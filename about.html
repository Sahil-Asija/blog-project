                <p>If you’re new to your industry and you need more experience to advance, doing a side hustle outside of your work hours can really help. It also applies if you’re trying to break into a specific industry and you don’t yet have a good enough portfolio to showcase your skills and experience.

                    A good portfolio makes you a much more attractive prospect for hire. So whether it’s future clients in your side hustle or hiring managers for your next job opportunity, you can’t go wrong with a strong portfolio.
                    
                    Essentially, you can use your side hustle as a way to get more work done that’s going to help advance your career. While your day job might pay the bills, you need to devote some of your time to your future prospects so you can keep moving forward.</p>

                    <p>LAs it stands, the industry and the Web3 space still need to mature a lot more before the general public will feel comfortable in working within it. Brands that want to preserve trust and protect their IP need to stay ahead of the curve. Securing blockchain domains and weaving them into the existing client experience when appropriate should help companies extend the trust they’ve built in a Web2 paradigm into the Web3 universe. For enterprises and established companies alike, things like NFTs and digital wallets may soon become a must. Anticipating those changes will enable burgeoning brands to stay ahead of the game and ahead of the competition.
